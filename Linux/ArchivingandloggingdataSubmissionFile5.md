### Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives

1. Command to **extract** the `TarDocs.tar` archive to the current directory:tar -xvf TarDocs.tar

2. Command to **create** the `Javaless_Doc.tar` archive from the `TarDocs/` directory, while excluding the `TarDocs/Documents/Java` directory:tar -cvf Javaless_Docs.tar projects


3. Command to ensure `Java/` is not in the new `Javaless_Docs.tar` archive:tar -tvf Javaless_Docs.tar | grep *java*


**Bonus** 
- Command to create an incremental archive called `logs_backup_tar.gz` with only changed files to `snapshot.file` for the `/var/log` directory:sudo tar -cvzf logs_backups.tar.gz /var/log


#### Critical Analysis Question

- Why wouldn't you use the options `-x` and `-c` at the same with `tar`?
 we did not use -x and - c options because -x option is used to extract a tar file while -c is used to create a tar file.

### Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs

1. Cron job for backing up the `/var/log/auth.log` file:# 0 6 * * 3 tar -zcf /var/backups/auth_backup.tgz /home//var/log/auth.log


---

### Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts

1. Brace expansion command to create the four subdirectories:sudo mkdir -p ~/backups/{freemem,diskuse,openlist,freedisk}

2. Paste your `system.sh` script edits below:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    free -h > ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt
    du -sh > ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt
     lsof | more > ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt
     df -h > ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt
    ```

3. Command to make the `system.sh` script executable:chmod +x system.sh

**Optional**
- Commands to test the script and confirm its execution:echo $?
0
**Bonus**
- Command to copy `system` to system-wide cron directory: * * * * 1 sudo cp /home/sysadmin/system.sh /etc/cron.d

---

### Step 4. Manage Log File Sizes
 
1. Run `sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf` to edit the `logrotate` configuration file. 

    Configure a log rotation scheme that backs up authentication messages to the `/var/log/auth.log`.

    - Add your config file edits below:

    ```bash
          /var/log/auth.log {
            rotate 7
            weekly
            notifempty
            delaycompress
            missingok
            endscript
        }   
    ```

### Bonus: Check for Policy and File Violations

1. Command to verify `auditd` is active:systemctl status auditd

2. Command to set number of retained logs and maximum log file size:sudo nano /etc/audit/auditd.conf

    - Add the edits made to the configuration file below:

    ```bash
    max_log_file = 35
    num_logs = 7

    ```

3. Command using `auditd` to set rules for `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/passwd` and `/var/log/auth.log`:sudo nano /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules


    - Add the edits made to the `rules` file below:

    ```bash
    -w /etc/shadow -p wra -k hashpass_audit
    -w /etc/passwd -p wra -k userpass_audit
    -w /var/log/auth.log -p wa -k authlog_audit
    ```

4. Command to restart `auditd`:sudo systemctl restart auditd

5. Command to list all `auditd` rules:sudo auditctl -l

6. Command to produce an audit report:sudo aureport -au

7. Create a user with `sudo useradd attacker` and produce an audit report that lists account modifications:sudo useradd attacker

8. Command to use `auditd` to watch `/var/log/cron`:sudo auditctl -w /var/log/cron

9. Command to verify `auditd` rules:sudo auditctl -l

---

### Bonus (Research Activity): Perform Various Log Filtering Techniques

1. Command to return `journalctl` messages with priorities from emergency to error: journalctl -b -1  -p "emerg".."err"

1. Command to check the disk usage of the system journal unit since the most recent boot:journalctl -b systemMaxuse systemd-journald

1. Comand to remove all archived journal files except the most recent two:journalctl --vacuum-files=2


1. Command to filter all log messages with priority levels between zero and two, and save output to `/home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt`:journalctl -b -1  -p "0".."2" >> /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt

1. Command to automate the last command in a daily cronjob. Add the edits made to the crontab file below:crontab -e

    ```bash
    * * * * 0 sudo journalctl -b -1  -p "0".."2" >> /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt
    ```
